Script update 2022-5-2 >
Includes updates for dual positives that are not also triple positive.
Uses intersectn.m script - this requires installing the "Statistics Toolbox" in Matlab because of the use of "combnk".

Edited to accept a single brain sections for analysis as well as multiple sections.

Still need to figure out the math for plotting the normalization graphs for dual positives when section numbers and channels are different. Currently, hardcoded for specific requirements.

Script update 2022-5-3 >
Created selectedVariableNames.mat files to load the appropriate variable names for files generated by StrataQuest depending on the number of channels.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Script update 2022-5-9 >
Added portion to data store for single channel files.
Added condition so that plotting dual can only happen with more than one channel and dap. If there is one channel only, the code should not run the "Plot dual" loop and also the normalized dual loop.
Added function for writing array for the Event Labels (E_array) array. << not sure this is useful.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Script update 2022-7-11 >
Added clearing and closing functions at beginning of script.
Added option to not display images.
Added saveas function to save figures as png.
Added permutation to deal with single channels.

Also plot "True Dual" (no possibility of being triple positive) vs. "Total Dual" (any dual positive cell, even ones that might be triple positive).
